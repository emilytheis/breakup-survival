Watch,Mary H,The Last Five Years,"This was a huge part of getting through my divorce. I first watched this movie only a few months before the divorce, and it was incredibly relatable for me. Plus, it's a musical, so not only could I watch it over and over I could also listen to and sing along with the soundtrack. It became this interesting indicator of how I was doing with the breakup: I started watching and sobbing throughout, or singing along and crying while walking home from the bus or whatever (I had a long period of crying in public a lot...). But as the months went by (it's been almost two years now since the divorce was final) I found myself watching it less and less, or when I did watch or listen the likelyhood of my bursting into tears lessened. I haven't watched it in...I'm not sure how long now, but several months, and the songs come up when I listen to my music on random, but it's more of a nostalgic feeling that I get from it now, rather than a visceral heartbreak type of feeling.

Think,Emer S.,Redefine success in a relationship,"As Dan Savage has said on his podccast, is a relationship really a failure just because it ended (even if it ended poorly)? What good/successful things happened in your past relationship that you want to make sure future relationships have? What did you learn in the ""trial and error"" process?",
Think,Emer S.,Focus on other forms of love,"Love is so much more than a romantic relationship. When I was single, I poured my energy into love of my family, friends, and community. Those foundations have lasted longer than any lover has, and often has been more rewarding for my sense of self and well-being. ",

Think,Sarah M,You are not a terrible person for wanting to break up with someone you love. ,You don’t need a reason to leave. Wanting to leave is enough. Leaving doesn’t mean you’re incapable of real love or that you’ll never love anyone else again. It doesn’t mean you’re morally bankrupt or psychologically demented or a nymphomaniac. It means you wish to change the terms of one particular relationship. That’s all. Be brave enough to break your own heart.,

Think,Susan B.,Just because someone doesn't love you doesn't mean you are unloveable. ,"During my senior year in college, I broke up with the first man I'd ever fallen in love with after he fell out of love with me. Also that year, I took an elective called Human Sexuality. During a class discussion on relationships, the teacher said this to the class. It's an assertion I've come back to many times since then because when you go through a break-up, you often think no one else will love you ever again.  The fact is that someone else does and/or will love you, in some capacity, at some point. Because you are worth loving. ",

When that date comes, that is your one time you get to think about whether or not to reach out. Spoiler: you won't want to talk to them. Then you pick another date a few weeks away.

Do,Michael D,Start an exercise routine.  ,"I agree with what so many people have said about the benefits of exercise, but I would suggest setting up a routine.

Do,Jessica H.,Let yourself feel it.,Don't be afraid to feel the worst of it. Cry as much and as often as you need to. Grieve it properly. The only way to get through and over all the emotions is to feel them.,
Do,,,"For me, I gave myself the freedom to talk as openly, honestly, and frequently as I needed or wanted to. I chose not to be afraid of being vulnerable with people about how I was feeling. Not only did it help me externally process my feelings, but the encouragement I received from my loved ones was invaluable. For others, bringing up the relationship and break-up has the opposite effect, pushing you back into the pit you've been trying to crawl out of. Internally processing is just as important, but there's something powerful about saying words out loud, almost as if speaking them aloud opens a window inside yourself to let everything go.",

The serenity prayer - ""God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference"" is a short simple one and Brene Brown talks about saying it on repeat during hard times in her life. Again it doesn't have to be religious at all, but it makes me feel a little more grounded and trust that maybe everything happens for a reason!!

Do,Leah G,Go on a terrible date,"Articulate all your angriest, nastiest feelings in a letter and then put it in an envelope, file it away somewhere, and never said it.

Do,Amanda,"I embraced my break-up in a slightly unconventional way.  I read a scientific paper that claimed that the most difficult part of a break-up is the tribe mentality; your brain believes you need the other person for survival and to retrain your brain, you need to do everyday activities 5 times without the other person to forge a new memory. ","So, I made an excel sheet with all of the things that I wanted to make a new memory for and told my friends, and we made it a mission to replace painful memories with new happy ones. It helped me feel in control, take back my city and our special places and it was fun. It gave me permission to go out and enjoy life even though I felt like dying inside my bed everyday. Eventually, I forgot about the excel sheet and was just happy.",
Do,Lisa A,Do something with a finish line ,"A race, a degree, a goal with a defined ending. It gives you something to focus on, provides confidence and a defined end is a relief with the seemingly endless nature of heartbreak.",
Do,Amy M.,"Make a list of everything you've learned from your exes (or other breakupees, friends included).","I keep a running list on my phone. It hurts so much to lose someone, especially someone who was tied in close to your heart, who changed you, who maybe even became part of you. Looking at this list reminds me that certain tiny parts of me I used to feel were tied to another person, or only existed thanks to that person - the part of me that learned to love falling apart over cute dogs on the street, or the part of me that learned how to roast potatoes perfectly, how to be vulnerable - is part of me, and not of them.

Do,Lillie R,"Stay friends if you can, but DON'T put up with bullshit. Don't make excuses for them, and if they break your rules -- break it off.","I had a very amicable breakup -- a job had me move to a different continent, and so my then-boyfriend and I decided to break up but wanted to stay in contact in case I came back to the States, and because nothing went wrong-- so we ideally could easily be friends. Turns out, it was much harder than expected. Lines were blurred, and after a while he became distant (for his own emotional protection, he said-- staying in contact but while apart was too hard). We set rules for how much we contact each other, and he kept breaking them -- doing things that (he said unintentionally) hurt me. I was putting in all the effort, and multiple times I told him to step things up. He'd recognize his faults, apologize, and try for a little while before reverting to his old ways. Eventually (very recently, actually) after one too many fuck-ups on his part, I cut him out entirely -- and I have been SO MUCH HAPPIER. It's SO EASY to make excuses for people -- but the truth is, you're worth more than that, and if you set rules or expectations and they break them, CUT THEM OUT. They'll try to tell you sorry, to convince you to keep them around -- and I'll be honest, I was convinced the first like 7 times. But they won't change, and you can do better and you deserve better.",

Do,Jessica A.,"Have your best friends make a typed out list of red-flags they saw, or things they didn't like about your relationship.","This was actually homework from a therapist I saw once! A few great friends did it and while it stung, it was important to revisit during those times when I felt weak and wanted to go back to him or romanticized the relationship. Even though I am now, 9 years later, happily married to a wonderful person, I still have those lists and it's nice to revisit to see how far I've come, both personally and in what I have come to expect from a partner.

Do,Emily,"My sister and I actually used to have what we called the ""breakup survival kit."" ","If one of us was going through a breakup, we'd go spend the day doing things that made us really happy. On one of those occasions, we decided to go out and buy something we would never buy. So we got red high-heels. And that sort of became the tradition. Red high-heels, chocolate, and we finished the day off with martinis.

Make the initial days or weeks easier.,"One day I woke up and realized I wanted something from the bin, not because it reminded me of him, but because it was MINE and I was ready to move forward. It helps not to see so many things that remind you of them, but keeps it around for when you're ready to move forward again, without being reminded/sad when wearing, using, or seeing something that reminds you of your S/O. I can't imagine ever throwing things away, but it was so healthy to get rid of it all for a while so I could learn to live without it and the memory of him.",
