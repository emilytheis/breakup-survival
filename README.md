# Breakup Survival Guide

This site is a repository of things to do, watch, read, listen to, and think during times of headache. It was inspired by the podcast Death Sex and Money's [Breakup](http://www.wnyc.org/story/cut-loose-breakups-death-sex-money/) episode and originally populated with suggestions from the show's listener-created Google Sheet [Breakup Survival Kit.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M42gLZLANOxXxl9-N2MEYcw0FW9ng2fSRhaLtrMykw0/edit) 

The site uses the [Tabletop.js library](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to access the Google Sheets API, serving up a randomized suggestion from [this curated list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RrHjz4goL9i8OlegZm9hqVluypc3LjNobOdCjVXdM7M/edit?usp=sharing) of over 400 heartbreak cures.
